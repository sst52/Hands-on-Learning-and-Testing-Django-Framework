Django is a web based framework

Can be used for storing databases as well as for running in server

manage.py is a file which used for running django web server as python manage.py runserver

For look into Django Services we use python manage.py migrate

For creating the user python manage.py createsuperuser -- To login into Django Admin for creating databases

For creating an app -- python manage.py startapp app_name

For renaming the app -- python manage.py startapp Changing_name

Main portion of created app is models.py -----

		class product(models.Model):
			-----body of the app-------

Now include the created app in settings.py

Now all the migrations are done inside the working directory
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
All we do makemigrations and migrate when there is change in models.py

Importing created model into admin.....
	In admin.py we use the following,
		from .models import class_name_inside_the_product
		admin.site.register(class_name_inside_the_product)

Upto the above process we used python admin to add the products..............................

Now we try to use the python shell to add the products

python manage.py shell
from product_name.models import *
class_name.objects.all() # To show all the products inside the app
class_name.objects.create(attributes=values,....) # To all values into database

Fields of data in Django can be caught in field-types of django documentation (google it...)
